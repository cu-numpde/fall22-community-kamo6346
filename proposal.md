# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *Eilmer: An 11-century Benedictine monk*

*Eilmer is a hypersonic flow solver built on a finite-volume formulation that is capable of solving the Navier-Stokes equations in 2D and 3D computational domains, discretised with structured or unstructured grids. Multiple slope limiters are implemented to ensure numerical stability near shocks and regions of strong gradients. *
